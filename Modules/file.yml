#file: The file module is used to manage files and directories on Amazon Linux instances. For example, the following playbook creates a directory /var/www/html and copies a file index.html to that directory:

---
 - name: Create document root directory
   hosts: localhost
   become: yes
   tasks:
    - name: Create directory
      file:
        path: /var/www/html
        state: directory
        owner: apache
        group: apache
        mode: '0755'
    - name: Copy index.html
      copy:
        src: index.html
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html
        owner: apache
        group: apache
        mode: '0644'
